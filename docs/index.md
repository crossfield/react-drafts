## Installation

`$ npm install react-drafts`


## Use
This package includes a Common module build at `/lib` and a UMD bundle in `/dist`. Most applications will use the Common build by importing `ReactDrafts` as below.

```
## editor parent component
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import ReactDrafts from 'react-drafts';

class MyEditor extends Component {
  ...

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <button onClick={this.handleSave}>Save</button>
        <button onClick={this.handleClear}>Clear</button>
        <ReactDrafts
          onFileUpload={this.handleFileUpload}
          exportTo="raw"
        />
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

To include styles, just import the css file from `/dist`, ie:

```
## manifest.css
@import <path_to>/node_modules/react-drafts/dist/react-drafts.css
```

See the demo directory for a more complete example. Demo contains a sample editor parent container that instantiates the `ReactDrafts` component and passes in props.
